# Overview of Python, Java, and JavaScript

This document provides a brief introduction to three popular programming languages: **Python**, **Java**, and **JavaScript**. Each language has unique features and is widely used in different domains of software development.

## Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It emphasizes code clarity and has a very clean syntax, making it a popular choice for beginners and experts alike.

- **Use cases:** Web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, scripting, and more.
- **Key features:**
  - Dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
  - Large standard library and extensive ecosystem of third-party packages.
  - Supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- **Example frameworks:** Django, Flask, TensorFlow, Pandas.

## Java

Java is a statically typed, compiled, object-oriented programming language designed for portability and performance. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), enabling "write once, run anywhere" capability.

- **Use cases:** Enterprise applications, Android app development, web servers, big data technologies, and large-scale systems.
- **Key features:**
  - Strong type checking and automatic memory management.
  - Platform independence via JVM.
  - Rich set of APIs and a robust ecosystem.
- **Example frameworks:** Spring, Hibernate, Apache Hadoop.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, dynamically typed scripting language primarily used for client-side web development but increasingly popular on the server side via environments like Node.js.

- **Use cases:** Interactive web pages, web applications, server-side programming, mobile app development, and even desktop apps.
- **Key features:**
  - Runs natively in web browsers.
  - Supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
  - Rich ecosystem with npm (Node Package Manager).
- **Example frameworks/libraries:** React, Angular, Vue.js, Express.js.

## Summary

| Language   | Typing           | Execution Environment           | Primary Use Cases                  |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Python     | Dynamic          | Interpreter (CPython, PyPy)    | Data science, automation, web    |
| Java       | Static           | JVM (Java Virtual Machine)     | Enterprise apps, Android, backend|
| JavaScript | Dynamic          | Browser & Node.js runtime      | Web development (frontend & backend)|
